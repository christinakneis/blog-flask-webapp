        <p>
            I’m a systems thinker and <strong>creative problem-solver</strong> who transforms <strong>complexity into strategy</strong>, 
            and strategy into tangible <strong>results</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the past decade, I’ve operated at the heart of NASA’s most ambitious missions, building 
            ground data systems, leading mission operations, and keeping spacecraft safe millions of miles 
            from Earth. My work spans <strong>product development</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, and <strong>operations leadership</strong>, pairing deep 
            technical expertise with the ability to communicate effectively, align stakeholders, and drive 
            complex projects forward. Whether architecting a system, scaling infrastructure, or tackling 
            high-stakes operational challenges, I’m known for <strong>delivering elegant, 
            high-impact solutions</strong> under pressure.
