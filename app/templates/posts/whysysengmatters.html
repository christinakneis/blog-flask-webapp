                    As artificial intelligence automates more technical tasks — from writing code to designing components — the biggest risks are no longer at the part level.
                    They’re at the <strong>system level</strong>, the <i>human</i> level: overlooked interfaces, misaligned goals, brittle architectures, and unintended consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s where <strong>systems engineers</strong> come in.
                </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">🚀 What *is* a Systems Engineer?</h2>
                <p>
                    A systems engineer is a <strong>big-picture strategist</strong> with the technical fluency to connect dots across domains.
                    We make sure a product, mission, or process works <em>as a whole</em> — not just in parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re translators between disciplines, designers of interfaces, and guardians of traceability.
                    We don’t just solve problems — we define them well in the first place.
                </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">🧩 Why You Need One</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complexity is rising:</strong> Modern projects are interdisciplinary by default. The more complex your system, the more you need someone thinking about interfaces, dependencies, and the end-to-end picture.</li>
                <li><strong>Teams are siloed:</strong> Specialists are essential — but without someone looking across the org chart, risk builds quietly at the seams.</li>
                <li><strong>No one else owns “the system”:</strong> Most teams own their *part* of the system. A systems engineer ensures someone owns the whole thing.</li>
                <li><strong>Failure is expensive:</strong> System-level failures are almost always preventable — if someone is watching.</li>
                <li><strong>Design needs purpose:</strong> A systems engineer ensures that every design decision is traceable back to stakeholder needs, not just technical whims.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-5">🛠️ What We Actually Do</h2>
            <p>Here’s what systems engineers bring to the table at various stages of the product lifecycle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Architect the System:</strong> Design how components interact to meet mission goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Bridge Disciplines:</strong> Translate between hardware, software, operations, and management.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigate Risk:</strong> Identify failure points early. Build resilience into the design.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure Traceability:</strong> Maintain a clear line from stakeholder needs to final implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitate Communication:</strong> Act as a liaison between teams to ensure alignment.</li>
                <li><strong>Drive Requirements:</strong> Turn messy needs into structured, testable expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Lead Trade Studies:</strong> Evaluate technical options against real constraints — performance, risk, schedule, cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Oversee Integration & Ops:</strong> Guide system verification, validate readiness, and support ongoing operations.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-5">🎯 Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                A good systems engineer doesn’t just make the system *work* — they make it *understandable, maintainable,* and *resilient*. If your project feels chaotic, scattered, or like nobody’s holding the bigger picture — that’s the void a systems engineer fills.
