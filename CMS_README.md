# Blog CMS (Content Management System)

Your blog has been upgraded with a comprehensive Content Management System that allows you to easily create, edit, and manage blog posts without touching code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the new required packages:

```bash
cd blog-flask-webapp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Initial Setup

1. **Start your Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. **Visit the setup page**: Go to `/admin/setup` in your browser
   - Create your first admin username and password
   - This will be your login credentials for the admin panel

3. **Log in to admin**: Go to `/admin/login` and use your credentials

### 3. Migrate Existing Posts

Run the migration script to transfer your existing hardcoded posts to the CMS:
